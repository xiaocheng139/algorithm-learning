# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
# product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
# check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the
# versions after a bad version are also bad.
# 
# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
# bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
# 
# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
# version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You
# should minimize the number of calls to the API.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
# 
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
# 
# Then 4 is the first bad version. 
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):

    def firstBadVersion(self, n):

        start = 0
        end = n - 1
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            if not isBadVersion(mid + 1):
                start = mid
            else:
                end = mid
        
        if not isBadVersion(start + 1):
            return end + 1
        else:
            return start + 1
